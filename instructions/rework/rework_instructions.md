You are performing a focused rework of code based on Pull Request review feedback.

## Your Primary Goal

Fix **every issue** raised in `pr_discussions.md`. This is NOT a new feature implementation — it is a targeted fix pass addressing reviewer concerns.

## Merge Conflicts (resolve before anything else)

If `merge_conflicts.md` is present in the input folder, the branch was automatically merged with the base branch and has unresolved conflicts. You **must** resolve them first:

1. Check which files have conflict markers: look at `merge_conflicts.md` or run `git status --short`
2. For each conflicting file, open it and resolve every `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` block — keep the correct/merged content
3. Stage each resolved file: `git add <file>`
4. Verify no markers remain: `git diff --check`
5. Only after all conflicts are staged, proceed to the review fixes below

Do NOT run `git commit` or `git merge --abort` — the commit is handled automatically.

## Approach

1. **Read `pr_discussions.md` first** — list all review comments and threads before touching any code
2. **Be surgical** — only change what is necessary to address the review. Do not refactor unrelated code, rename unrelated variables, or add unrequested features
3. **Address BLOCKING issues first** (security, critical bugs), then IMPORTANT, then SUGGESTIONS
4. **If a SUGGESTION is minor and time-consuming**, you may skip it but explicitly note it in `outputs/response.md`

## What You Must NOT Do

- Do not introduce new logic unrelated to fixing review comments
- Do not create new branches or push code — this is automated
- Do not change the ticket scope — you are fixing, not re-implementing
- Do not ignore any BLOCKING or IMPORTANT review comment

## Tests

After all fixes:
- Run the full test suite: compile and run all unit tests
- If any tests break due to your changes, fix them
- If the reviewer asked for new tests, add them

## Output — Two files required

### 1. `outputs/response.md` — Human-readable fix summary (posted as general PR comment)

Write in clear GitHub Markdown:

```markdown
## Rework Summary

### Fixed Issues

**Thread 1 — `path/to/file.js` line 42**
- Issue: <what the reviewer raised>
- Fix: <what was changed and why>
- Files: `src/foo.js`, `src/bar.js`

### Skipped (with justification)
[Only if any suggestions were intentionally skipped]

### Test Status
[Pass/Fail + test changes made]
```

### 2. `outputs/review_replies.json` — Per-thread replies (posted as replies in each discussion thread)

For **every thread** in `pr_discussions_raw.json`, produce a reply entry.
Use the `rootCommentId` as `inReplyToId` and `id` as `threadId`:

```json
{
  "replies": [
    {
      "inReplyToId": 1234567890,
      "threadId": "PRRT_kwDOABC123",
      "reply": "Fixed: extracted validation into `InputValidator` class. See `src/validators/InputValidator.js`."
    }
  ]
}
```

- `inReplyToId` — from `pr_discussions_raw.json` → `threads[i].rootCommentId`
- `threadId` — from `pr_discussions_raw.json` → `threads[i].id`
- `reply` — short, specific description of the fix (1-3 sentences)
- Include an entry for **every non-resolved thread**, even if you only partially addressed it
- If `pr_discussions_raw.json` is absent or empty, write `{ "replies": [] }`

**IMPORTANT**: You are only responsible for code fixes and writing these two files — git commit, push, and posting to GitHub are automated.
